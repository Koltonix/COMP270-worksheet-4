# COMP270 Worksheet 4

> Unity Engine 2019.4.1fs

### Abstract
The goal of this project is to procedurally generate an isometric sort of map using mesh generation. I then intend to apply a height shader to give it depth. I would also quite like to have custom terrains and biomes if time allows.


### To Do
- Create Triplinar Shader in Unity
- ~~Perlin Noise Map Generation~~
- ~~Mesh Generation~~
- ~~Non-Contiguous Generation~~
- ~~Getting each quad in an array to act as a Tile (for gameplay purposes)~~
- Water Shader
