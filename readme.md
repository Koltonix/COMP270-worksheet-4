# COMP270 Worksheet 4

> Unity Engine 2019.4.1fs

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to procedurally generate an isometric sort of map using mesh generation. I then intend to apply a height shader to give it depth. I would also quite like to have custom terrains and biomes if time allows.

### To Do
- ~~Create Triplinar Shader in Unity~~
- ~~Perlin Noise Map Generation~~
- ~~Mesh Generation~~
- ~~Non-Contiguous Generation~~
- ~~Getting each quad in an array to act as a Tile (for gameplay purposes)~~
- Water Shader
